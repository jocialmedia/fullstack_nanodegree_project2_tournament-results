# Option 1. Run a new tournament.
This is an example for a Elimination tournament with 4 players:

If there are no players in the database, 32 players are created from a wide range of names and ages. They receive a random gender and random birthday:

# Option 4. Install or reset the database.
It is easy to delete the whole data:

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Git and Python installed on your computer. In case, you run into trouble getting Git, Python, Vagrant and Postgresql to run on your computer please take a look at this [detailed instructions](https://docs.google.com/a/knowlabs.com/document/d/16IgOm4XprTaKxAa8w02y028oBECOoB1EI1ReddADEeY/pub?embedded=true) by udactiy.

2. Clone the original code from the Udacity Git-Repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm.git```

3. Clone the code from this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone jocialmedia/fullstack_nanodegree_project2_tournament-results.git```

4. Now copy the following files from fullstack_nanodegree_project2_tournament/tournament/
to the directory vagrant/tournament from udacity:
```
tournament.py
tournament_for_testing.py
tournament.sql
tournament_ressources.json
tournament_test.py```

5. Go to the directory with the file **Vagrantfile** and start the vagrant server with:
```
vagrant up```

6. Login to the server with:
```
vagrant ssh```

7. Go to the directory of the project tournament 
```
cd /vagrant/tournament```

8. Log in to the Postgresql-Database:
```
psql
``` 

9. The following command imports the whole content of **tournament.sql** into the database:
```
\i tournament.sql
```

10. Now you can log out of psql
```
\q```

11. And when you are still in the right project directory you can start the program with python:
```
python tournament.py```

12. The same way you can start the testing file:
```
python tournament_test.py```


## Testing

In order to work with the large modifications to the code base I had to do some changes on the tournament_test.py as well. I also had to use a little trick because every time I imported tournament.py into tournament_test.py the automatic menu function started before the testing process. That is why I copied the file tournament.py to tournament_for_testing.py and deactivated the last two lines to prevent the menu from starting.

This is the testing after a successful run:
